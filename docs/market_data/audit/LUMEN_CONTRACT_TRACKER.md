# LUMEN_CONTRACT_TRACKER

## Traceability / Linkage / Publishability / Correction Guard Session

Status: DONE

## Contract status

1. **source traceability persistence** → DONE
   - source context is persisted in `eod_runs`
   - runtime output and DB fields both prove traceability exists beyond notes/events

2. **run/publication linkage** → DONE
   - `eod_runs.publication_id`
   - `eod_runs.publication_version`
   - `eod_runs.correction_id`
   - `eod_publications.run_id`
   - linkage is explicit and queryable

3. **publishability metadata** → DONE
   - `eod_runs.final_reason_code` persisted
   - terminal/publishability outcome visible in command output and DB
   - coverage gate rejection proven at runtime (`RUN_COVERAGE_LOW` / `NOT_READABLE`)

4. **correction/reseal guard minimum** → DONE
   - correction linkage persists on owning run
   - finalize / correction mismatch paths stay guarded
   - test suite coverage confirms guard behavior remains intact

## Concrete DB contract additions

Added to `eod_runs`:
- `source_name`
- `source_provider`
- `source_input_file`
- `source_timeout_seconds`
- `source_retry_max`
- `source_attempt_count`
- `source_success_after_retry`
- `source_retry_exhausted`
- `source_final_http_status`
- `source_final_reason_code`
- `publication_id`
- `publication_version`
- `correction_id`
- `final_reason_code`

## Verification completed in this session

### PHPUnit
- `MarketDataBackfillServiceTest` → PASS
- full suite → PASS (`192/192`)

### Runtime command proof
- manual-file daily run completes through FINALIZE
- source trace fields render in command output
- candidate publication linkage appears in notes/output
- coverage gate rejects insufficient manual file correctly

### DB/runtime interpretation
- write-side persistence contract is working
- publication is not silently promoted when publishability fails
- command output, DB persistence, and tests are aligned

## Non-blocking observation

- manual-file range/backfill with a single-date input file is operationally unsuitable for cross-date range ingestion
- this does not invalidate the write-side contract completed in this session

## Final conclusion

SESSION STATUS: DONE
WRITE-SIDE PIPELINE: HARDENED
READ-SIDE: NOT YET ENFORCED

## Next contract target

### READ-SIDE ENFORCEMENT

1. consumer read contract enforcement
2. pointer / effective-date enforcement
3. anti raw-table bypass
4. anti MAX(date)
5. fail-safe read behavior
