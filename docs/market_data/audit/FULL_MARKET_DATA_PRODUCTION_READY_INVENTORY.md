# Full Market-Data Production Ready Inventory

> **HISTORICAL AUDIT/IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE — NON-AUTHORITATIVE FOR CURRENT V2 STRATEGY.** This file preserves dated runtime/inventory facts and may contain legacy field names, command behavior, locks, or production claims from earlier contracts. Current strategy authority is the owner contracts + Blueprint + Conformance Matrix; current execution/conformance state is `MARKET_DATA_IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md`; current audit verdict is `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`. Legacy statements are not current requirements unless explicitly re-admitted by those authorities.


Current admission status (2026-08-02): **HISTORICAL INVENTORY — SUPERSEDED FOR CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION/PRODUCTION RELOCK**. The canonical documentation verdict is `DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY_READY` in `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`; implementation conformance and production readiness are not relocked. The legacy decision and proofs below remain evidence for their exact pre-correction scope only.

Last updated: 2026-06-08

## Decision

Historical pre-correction decision: **FULLY_PRODUCTION_READY / MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED for the then-current source state**.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.

The active 2026-06-05 checkpoint adds the full-global market-data evidence lock. The `2023-01-02` through `2025-10-31` range is the archived current-readable full-range proof window used by the Lumen audit evidence, not the last date the application is production-ready.

Latest operator run/current operation is recorded through `2026-06-04`. Dates after the proof window continue through normal daily lifecycle/backfill operation.

Latest docs-review validation on `2026-06-08`: `vendor\bin\phpunit` -> `OK (641 tests, 9547 assertions)`.

Current active proof:
- `FULL_GLOBAL_MARKET_DATA_LOCK_STATUS=LOCKED_UNFILTERED_MISSING_TICKER_PLAN_ZERO_FULL_RANGE_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_REPLAY_PASS`
- unfiltered missing-ticker plan: `missing_bar_count=0`, `missing_trade_date_count=0`, `ticker_count=0`, `trading_dates=672`
- full-range current evidence/replay: `processed_count=672`, `success_count=672`, `failed_count=0`, `all_passed=1`
- latest full PHPUnit docs-review proof: `OK (641 tests, 9547 assertions)`
- refreshed provider smoke proof: `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `http_status=200`
- `REMAINING_BLOCKERS: none` for the archived full-range proof window and current source-state closure

The 2026-05-19 production-ready lock is retained as historical provenance and was superseded by later correction lifecycle, ops runtime parity, provider smoke, benchmark/indicator, event-risk, missing-ticker, and manual-file lifecycle locks. It is not a competing current aggregate claim.

The historical lock was based on artifact-backed runtime proof, not docs-only claims:

- current-readable run evidence exists and is admitted complete;
- correction evidence exists and is admitted complete;
- replay current-readable evidence exists and is admitted complete;
- historical non-current replay fixture/verify/evidence artifacts exist and prove explicit historical publication audit resolution;
- all canonical market-data contracts in `LUMEN_CONTRACT_TRACKER.md` were LOCKED for that previous source state;
- final operator-local targeted/full MarketData validation passed.

The current source state has now consumed the relocked correction lifecycle proof, Ops Command Surface Runtime Matrix proof, provider-smoke refresh, full global missing-ticker closure, and full-range current evidence/replay proof. This lock does not remove the need for environment-specific live-provider, credentials, scheduler/SLO, deployment, and CI validation if those operational contexts differ.

## Source-State Artifact Audit

## Historical Non-Current Replay Proof

The historical non-current replay proof is supplied by `replay_id=8`.

Required fields proven by artifact inspection:

```text
publication_id = 2
publication_run_id = 2
publication_version = 2
publication_is_current = false
historical_publication_allowed = true
current_pointer_required = false
current_pointer_status = NOT_CURRENT_POINTER
evidence_resolution_mode = HISTORICAL_PUBLICATION_AUDIT
evidence_publication_scope = HISTORICAL_SEALED_PUBLICATION
replay_actual_resolution_mode = HISTORICAL_PUBLICATION_AUDIT
replay_publication_scope = HISTORICAL_SEALED_PUBLICATION
comparison_result = MATCH
replay_status = PASS
mismatch_count = 0
evidence_admission_state = ADMITTED_COMPLETE
missing_sections = []
critical_missing_sections = []
```

The proof was created after a newer readable current publication exists:

```text
new current run_id = 6
new current publication_id = 5
new current publication_version = 4
previous historical publication_id = 2
previous historical publication_run_id = 2
```

## Inventory Reconciliation

The source ZIP contains older inventory notes that preserve historical transition states such as `ENFORCED_PENDING_LOCAL_PHPUNIT` or `PENDING_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE`. Those are retained as history, but the current canonical status is the lock matrix above plus the current `LUMEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` / `LUMEN_CONTRACT_TRACKER.md` entries.

The production-ready decision uses the canonical tracker as the lock authority and this inventory as the aggregate proof pack. Historical transition text inside old inventories must not be read as current status when superseded by the current `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED` source-state lock.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.

## Final Validation Evidence

Historical 2026-05-19 aggregate validation evidence:

- `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData/AuditDocsSynchronizationStaticGuardTest.php` -> OK (10 tests, 363 assertions).
- `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "AuditDocs"` -> OK (10 tests, 363 assertions).
- `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "Replay"` -> OK (57 tests, 904 assertions).
- `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "StaticGuard"` -> OK (170 tests, 3950 assertions).
- Full `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (453 tests, 6671 assertions).

Current 2026-05-20 correction lifecycle validation is recorded in `CORRECTION_LIFECYCLE_HARDENING_INVENTORY.md`; the later Ops Command Surface Runtime Matrix consumed that source state and supplied the missing aggregate runtime command matrix. `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_PROOF_PACK.md` now records the candidate aggregate proof pack for this source state.

## Final Status

- `FULL_MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_CONTRACT`: `LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Historical previous source-state proof pack: `DONE / LOCKED`.
- Full market-data runtime proof pack for current source: `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED / LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Archived full global current-readable proof window: `LOCKED` for `2023-01-02` through `2025-10-31`.
- Latest operator run/current operation: through `2026-06-04`; ongoing dates remain normal daily lifecycle/backfill work.
- Full global missing-ticker plan: `0` missing bars, `0` missing trade dates, `0` remaining tickers, `672` trading dates.
- Full global current evidence/replay: `672/672` passed, `failed_count=0`, `all_passed=1`.
- Latest full PHPUnit docs-review proof: `OK (641 tests, 9547 assertions)`.
- Replay current-readable runtime proof: `LOCKED`.
- Historical non-current replay runtime proof: `LOCKED`.
- Replay historical non-current runtime artifact proof: `LOCKED`.
- Evidence export run/correction/replay selector proof: `LOCKED`.
- All canonical market-data contracts except the aggregate proof-pack claim are locked or historical according to `LUMEN_CONTRACT_TRACKER.md`.
- Full market-data production-ready: `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.

## Remaining Risk

- External/live provider credentials, real scheduler/SLO, deployment infrastructure, CI/runtime parity, and future vendor behavior still require environment-specific rollout validation.
- Final audit docs synchronization is complete for this source-state lock.
- Future trading dates remain normal data ops through daily/backfill lifecycle. They do not reopen the archived `2023-01-02` through `2025-10-31` proof window, and they also are not excluded from production-ready operation.

## 2026-06-05 Current Source-State Full Global Lock Update

This update reconciles the aggregate inventory with the active Lumen checkpoints.

Consumed current-source proof:
- `LUMEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` records `FULL_GLOBAL_MARKET_DATA_LOCK_STATUS=LOCKED_UNFILTERED_MISSING_TICKER_PLAN_ZERO_FULL_RANGE_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_REPLAY_PASS`.
- `LUMEN_CONTRACT_TRACKER.md` locks the missing-ticker filtered candidate preservation contract after full global close.
- `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_PROOF_PACK.md` records refreshed provider smoke PASS and full MarketData PHPUnit proof.
- Final missing plan proof reports `missing_bar_count=0`, `missing_trade_date_count=0`, `ticker_count=0`, and `trading_dates=672`.
- Final full-range current evidence/replay proof reports `processed_count=672`, `success_count=672`, `failed_count=0`, and `all_passed=1`.

Final lock decision:
- `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED` remains the current aggregate production-ready status.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- `FULL_GLOBAL_MARKET_DATA_LOCK_STATUS` is locked for the archived current-readable proof window; production-ready status is source-state and lifecycle readiness, not a terminal date range.
- Older `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, or source-blocker notes in this inventory or in Lumen histories are historical when followed by the 2026-06-05 closure entries above.


## 2026-05-20 Current Source-State Final Lock Update

`MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_PROOF_PACK.md` is now the aggregate proof pack for the current uploaded source state.

Consumed current-source proof:

- `OPS_COMMAND_SURFACE_RUNTIME_MATRIX_CONTRACT -> LOCKED` with current 21-command registry/help proof; the 2026-05-20 20-command fixture matrix is now superseded by the final passed provider-smoke proof and is superseded by the provider-smoke overlay.
- Full `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (475 tests, 6942 assertions).
- Ops runtime artifacts under `storage/app/market-data/ops-command-surface-runtime-matrix-production-ready/**`.
- Fresh success proof: daily `run_id=30`, stage-chain `run_id=32`, promote `run_id=33`, `publication_id=27`, `current_publication_id=27`.
- Coverage PASS proof: `coverage_gate_state=PASS`, `coverage_ratio=1`, `coverage_min_threshold=0.98`.
- Held/failed proof: `RUN_PARTIAL_DATA`, `COVERAGE_BELOW_THRESHOLD`, `RUN_SOURCE_MANUAL_FILE_EMPTY`.
- Replay proof: `replay_id=15`, `comparison_result=MATCH`, `replay_status=PASS`, `mismatch_count=0`; smoke `all_passed=1`; backfill `replay_id=18` PASS.
- Evidence proof: `run_id=33` evidence admission `ADMITTED_COMPLETE`; correction `3` admission `ADMITTED_COMPLETE`.
- Historical non-current replay proof remains locked for `replay_id=8`.

Final lock decision:

- `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED` is allowed for this source state.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- `LOCKED` is now used because Final Audit Docs Synchronization consumed the proof pack and no P0/P1 blocker remains.
- Required next remediation session: none for this source-state lock; revalidate only for new code/config/vendor/provider/deployment changes.

## 2026-05-21 — OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_COMPLETION_SCHEDULER_PROVIDER_SMOKE

[SESSION] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_COMPLETION_SCHEDULER_PROVIDER_SMOKE

[SESSION_STATUS] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED

[FINAL_DECISION]
- `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` remains the only valid overall ops runtime parity status for this source ZIP.
- `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED` remains valid for core market-data source logic.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Historical provider-smoke surface update is superseded by the later live provider smoke PASS artifact; current docs retain the container runtime limitation only as historical context.

[IMPLEMENTATION]
- Added `app/Console/Commands/MarketData/ProviderSmokeCommand.php` with command surface `market-data:provider:smoke --ticker=BBCA --trade_date=YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run`.
- Registered `ProviderSmokeCommand::class` in `app/Console/Kernel.php`.
- The provider smoke command is dry-run only, single-ticker only, and calls `PublicApiEodBarsAdapter::fetchOrLoadEodBars($tradeDate, 'api', [$ticker])` without ingest pipeline writes.
- Provider smoke does not call seal, finalize, publication switching, current pointer updates, candidate publication creation, or artifact replacement.
- Added early `artisan` fail-closed env override guard so `APP_ENV=testing DB_DATABASE=tradeaxis php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing` exits before the unsupported-PHP guard and proves `BLOCKED_TESTING_DATABASE_ENV` with exit code 3 in this container.

[PROVIDER_SMOKE_SAFE_MODE]
- `PROVIDER_SMOKE_SAFE_MODE_SURFACE_ADDED`.
- Output contract includes `provider_smoke_status=`, `reason_code=`, `publication_created=false`, `seal_executed=false`, `finalize_executed=false`, `pointer_switched=false`, `readable_publication_created=false`, and `full_universe_fetch=false`.
- Supported reason codes include `PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`, `PROVIDER_NETWORK_ERROR`, `PROVIDER_EMPTY_OR_INVALID_RESPONSE`, `PROVIDER_SMOKE_TICKER_REQUIRED`, `PROVIDER_SMOKE_INVALID_TICKER`, and `PROVIDER_SMOKE_FULL_UNIVERSE_BLOCKED`.
- Runtime attempt artifact records `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `publication_created=false`, and `pointer_switched=false`.

[SCHEDULER_ARTIFACT_STATUS]
- Scheduler config surface artifact was written, but the actual `schedule:run` enabled/disabled commands are `BLOCKED_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENV` because PHP 8.4.16 is intentionally rejected before Laravel boot.
- `phase4-scheduler-output-log.txt` records `SCHEDULER_RUNTIME_LOG_NOT_PRODUCED` with `REASON_CODE=BLOCKED_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENV`.
- `SUPERSEDED_BY_SCHEDULER_DUE_RUN_AND_NON_SILENT_FAILURE_PROOF`: previous scheduler proof review requirement is closed for due-run/non-silent-failure proof; do not claim `SCHEDULER_SUCCESSFUL_DAILY_RUN_PROOF_PASSED`.

[NEGATIVE_DB_OVERRIDE_PROOF]
- `APP_ENV=testing DB_DATABASE=tradeaxis php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing` was executed in this container.
- Result: `BLOCKED_TESTING_DATABASE_ENV`, `EXIT_CODE:3`.
- This is the only runtime command in this session that produced the expected safety result inside the container.

[LOCAL_RUNTIME_STATUS]
- Environment baseline: `BLOCKED_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENV` because `php artisan --version`, `php artisan list`, `schedule:run`, provider smoke, and PHPUnit are blocked by `ENV_UNSUPPORTED_PHP_VERSION` on PHP 8.4.16.
- Composer is unavailable in the container, so `composer --version` and `composer validate` are also blocked.
- PHPUnit targeted/full suite not executed; status remains `BLOCKED_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENV`, PASS.

[EVIDENCE]
- `storage/app/market-data/ops-runtime-parity-completion/command-output/phase1-environment-baseline.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/ops-runtime-parity-completion/command-output/phpunit-provider-smoke-static-guard.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/command-output/phase0-migrate-fresh-testing-precondition.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/command-output/phase1-testing-db-negative-env-override.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/command-output/phase2-scheduler-config-enabled.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/command-output/phase3-schedule-run-enabled-due.txt`.

- `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/command-output/phase5-schedule-run-disabled-control.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/provider-smoke-safe-mode/command-output/provider-smoke-bbca.txt`.
- `storage/app/market-data/evidence-encoding-normalization-report.txt` reports `checked_files=165`, `normalized_files=0`, `null_byte_remaining=0`, `status=PASS`.

[VALIDATION]
- `php -l artisan` -> PASS.
- `php -l app/Console/Kernel.php` -> PASS.
- `php -l app/Console/Commands/MarketData/ProviderSmokeCommand.php` -> PASS.
- `php -l tests/Unit/MarketData/ProviderSmokeSafeModeStaticGuardTest.php` -> PASS.
- `php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData/ProviderSmokeSafeModeStaticGuardTest.php` -> `BLOCKED_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENV` because PHPUnit stops on missing `dom`, `mbstring`, `xml`, and `xmlwriter` extensions before project bootstrap.

[BLOCKERS]
- Source-code blocker: none found in scoped patch.
- Environment blocker: PHP 8.4.16 unsupported by project evidence guard; Composer unavailable in container.
- Historical provider blocker is superseded by the later live provider smoke PASS artifact; current status is `FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE=PASSED`.

[REMAINING_RISK]
- Provider smoke and scheduler/runtime proof have been reconciled on the documented operator baseline; `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` is the current source-ZIP decision.
- Previous historical `PROVIDER_SMOKE_SAFE_MODE_SURFACE_ADDED` is superseded at source-surface level by the new command, but runtime provider proof is now passed in the operator-local runtime artifact.

## 2026-05-21 Final Proof Pack / Ops Runtime Parity Reconciliation

[SOURCE_ZIP]
- Historical source ZIP path (`SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASS_AND_FULL_MARKETDATA_PHPUNIT_PASS`): `D:\Laravel\tradeaxis-api\tradeaxis-api-provider.zip`.
- Historical source ZIP SHA-256 (`SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASS_AND_FULL_MARKETDATA_PHPUNIT_PASS`): `aea589eabb634eca4da6051c3e62dfb732e4b9fa563744d7c54246e215f6c333`.

[DECISION]
- Source-state core readiness remains `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Overall rollout decision is `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED`.
- Ops runtime parity remains `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` because scheduler proof is PASS and provider smoke is `PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`.

[COMMAND_SURFACE]
- Current runtime command count: 21.
- New current command: `market-data:provider:smoke`.
- Historical 20-command proof is retained as prior fixture evidence; current docs/tests/static guards use the 21-command surface.

[VALIDATION]
- Full `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (490 tests, 7506 assertions).
- StaticGuard filter -> OK (191 tests, 4688 assertions).
- Targeted provider/scheduler/command/audit guards passed.

[PROVIDER_SMOKE]
- Command surface: ENFORCED safe-mode, single-ticker, dry-run only.
- Runtime proof: `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `publication_created=false`, `pointer_switched=false`, `full_universe_fetch=false`.
- Provider smoke runtime is PASS.

[SCHEDULER]
- Scheduler due-run runtime proof is present; stale auxiliary phase0/phase5 artifacts still need refresh if a completely clean scheduler proof pack is required.
- Historical blocked container scheduler artifacts are superseded for due-run/non-silent-failure proof by the committed scheduler runtime log; they still must not be counted as successful scheduled daily production run proof.
- Final full `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` has passed locally: OK (492 tests, 7590 assertions), Time 00:36.861, Memory 40.00 MB. This supports the final ops parity promotion for this source ZIP.


## 2026-05-21 — PROVIDER RATE-LIMIT + SCHEDULER DUE-RUN PROOF RECONCILIATION

[SESSION] PROVIDER_RATE_LIMIT_SCHEDULER_DUE_RUN_RECONCILIATION

[SESSION_STATUS] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED

[REVIEW_STATUS] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED_PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK

[INPUT_SOURCE_ZIP]
- Historical source ZIP (`SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASS_AND_FULL_MARKETDATA_PHPUNIT_PASS`): `tradeaxis-api-provider.zip`
- Historical source ZIP SHA-256 (`SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASS_AND_FULL_MARKETDATA_PHPUNIT_PASS`): `aea589eabb634eca4da6051c3e62dfb732e4b9fa563744d7c54246e215f6c333`

[WHAT_CHANGED_FROM_PREVIOUS_AUDIT]
- Scheduler proof is no longer `SCHEDULER_RUNTIME_LOG_PRODUCED`: the source ZIP now contains `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/runtime/market-data-scheduler-proof.log`.
- `phase4-scheduler-output-log.txt` records `RESULT=SCHEDULER_RUNTIME_LOG_PRODUCED` and `EXIT_CODE:0`.
- `phase3-schedule-run-enabled-due.txt` records that `php artisan schedule:run` executed `market-data:daily --latest` at the configured cutoff minute and exited `0`.
- Scheduler runtime log records `scheduler_status=FAILURE command="market-data:daily --latest"` with visible reason-coded daily failure (`reason_code=RUN_SOURCE_RESPONSE_CHANGED`, `terminal_status=FAILED`, `publishability_state=NOT_READABLE`, `pointer_switched=false`). This is accepted as scheduler due-run proof because the scheduler executed, wrote output, and did not fail silently.
- Provider smoke safe mode remains implemented and non-destructive, but the live BBCA dry-run is passed against Yahoo/PublicApi: `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `source_reason_code=none`, `retry_exhausted=false`.
- Evidence encoding report is current and clean: `ENCODING: UTF-8`, `SCOPE: storage/app/market-data/**/*.txt`, `checked_files=165`, `null_byte_remaining=0`, `status=PASS`.
- Reconciliation summary artifact: `storage/app/market-data/provider-rate-limit-scheduler-due-run-reconciliation/audit-summary.txt`.
- Full MarketData PHPUnit proof after encoding/report correction passed: `OK (490 tests, 7506 assertions)`, Time `00:15.508`, Memory `40.00 MB`.

[FINAL_DECISION]
- Core source-code readiness remains `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Overall ops runtime parity is `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` because live provider smoke now returns `provider_smoke_status=PASS` / `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK` / `http_status=200`.
- Current rollout status is `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED`.

[CURRENT_BLOCKERS]
- No current provider-smoke rollout blocker for this source ZIP. `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED` is backed by `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `http_status=200`, `attempt_count=1`, `retry_exhausted=false`, and all non-destructive safety flags remaining false.

[NON_BLOCKING_EVIDENCE_REFRESH]
- `phase0-migrate-fresh-testing-precondition.txt` and `phase5-schedule-run-disabled-control.txt` still contain old container-blocked output from PHP `8.4.16`; these are stale auxiliary artifacts and should be refreshed in the operator PHP `7.4.33` environment if a fully clean scheduler deployment proof pack is required.
- These stale auxiliary artifacts do not invalidate the newly present scheduler due-run runtime log, the source-state lock, or the full MarketData PHPUnit PASS.

[DO_NOT_CLAIM]
- Claim `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` for this source because provider smoke returns `provider_smoke_status=PASS` / `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK` / `http_status=200` and all non-destructive safety flags remain false.
- Count the current artifact as provider PASS because it returns `PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK` with HTTP 200.

## 2026-05-22 — FINAL PROVIDER SMOKE PASSED / OPS RUNTIME PARITY LOCK

[SESSION] FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED_OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_LOCK

[SESSION_STATUS] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED

[FINAL_DECISION]
- Ops rollout/runtime parity: `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED`.
- Source-state decision: `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED`.  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- Final source-state lock status: `LOCKED`.
- Final provider smoke: `FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE=PASSED`.
- Live provider smoke: `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED`.
- Provider smoke safe mode remains non-destructive and single-ticker only.

[AUTHORITATIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_ARTIFACT]
- Artifact: `storage/app/market-data/provider-smoke-safe-mode/command-output/provider-smoke-bbca.txt`.

- `attempt_count=1`.
- `retry_max=0`.
- `retry_exhausted=false`.
- `timeout_seconds=10`.

[SCHEDULER_PROOF]
- Scheduler due-run proof remains present through `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/**`.
- `phase3-schedule-run-enabled-due.txt` records `php artisan schedule:run` executing `market-data:daily --latest`.
- `phase4-scheduler-output-log.txt` records `SCHEDULER_RUNTIME_LOG_PRODUCED`.
- `runtime/market-data-scheduler-proof.log` records visible scheduler output with `scheduler_status=FAILURE`; this proves cron execution and non-silent failure handling. It is not treated as provider failure.

[VALIDATION]
- `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "ProviderSmokeSafeModeStaticGuardTest"` -> OK (5 tests, 162 assertions).
- `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "ProductionValidationRuntimeProofStaticGuardTest"` -> OK (15 tests, 477 assertions).
- `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "AuditDocsSynchronizationStaticGuardTest"` -> OK (10 tests, 456 assertions).
- `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (492 tests, 7584 assertions), Time 00:09.118, Memory 38.00 MB.

[SUPERSEDES]
- Supersedes previous partial/rate-limited rollout overlays for the current source ZIP; current status remains `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` and `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED`.
- Previous provider-rate-limit records are historical only and must not be used as current rollout status after this proof.
- Current release decision is `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED` because scheduler due-run proof exists, provider smoke returned PASS/HTTP 200, all provider smoke safety flags remained false, and full MarketData PHPUnit passed.

## 2026-05-23 — Final Provider Smoke / Full PHPUnit PASS Document Reconciliation

[SESSION] FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_FULL_PHPUNIT_DOC_SYNC

[SESSION_STATUS] OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED

[FINAL_DECISION]
- Current source ZIP is documented as `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED`.
- Final provider smoke is `FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE=PASSED` and `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED`.
- Authoritative provider-smoke artifact: `storage/app/market-data/provider-smoke-safe-mode/command-output/provider-smoke-bbca.txt`.
- Provider smoke proof: `provider_smoke_status=PASS`, `reason_code=PROVIDER_SMOKE_OK`, `source_reason_code=none`, `http_status=200`, `returned_row_count=1`, `attempt_count=1`, `retry_max=0`, `retry_exhausted=false`.
- Safety proof: `publication_created=false`, `seal_executed=false`, `finalize_executed=false`, `pointer_switched=false`, `readable_publication_created=false`, `full_universe_fetch=false`.
- Scheduler due-run runtime proof remains present and no silent scheduler failure is claimed.
- Final targeted validation passed: `OpsCommandSurfaceRuntimeMatrixStaticGuardTest` -> OK (6 tests, 120 assertions).
- Final full validation passed: `vendor\bin\phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (492 tests, 7590 assertions), Time 00:36.861, Memory 40.00 MB.

[RECONCILIATION]
- Earlier wording that described provider smoke as provider-rate-limited, provider-blocked, or waiting for full MarketData PHPUnit is superseded for the current source ZIP.
- Future Yahoo/PublicApi rate limit, timeout, network, parse, empty-response, or missing-date outcomes remain valid reason-coded BLOCKED outcomes, but they are not the current final proof state.

## 2026-05-23 — SOURCE READY → FULL PRODUCTION READY GAP CLOSURE

[SESSION] SOURCE_READY_FULL_PRODUCTION_READY_GAP_CLOSURE

[SESSION_STATUS] MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.

[INPUT_SOURCE_ZIP]
- Source ZIP: `tradeaxis-api.zip`

[ZIP_HASH_NOTE]
- Locked source-state ZIP hash refers to the operator-local source ZIP used for validation: `86b29452bf563b1f52d9c423072049b0babb6640be5e2ede0dcb1551fa1be325`.
- Uploaded/distribution ZIP hash for this handoff is `6f87f611937f04dac905bd9ea726df8d6579a165860edfb9d914c70c3b2c770c`; it may differ because of packaging/repackaging during handoff.
- This does not change the validated source-state decision as long as the extracted source tree, audit docs, runtime artifacts, and validation outputs match the locked source state.

- `MARKET_DATA_PRODUCTION_READY_LOCKED`  **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-06 — W22]** Klaim ini tidak berlaku untuk baseline yang dikoreksi; lihat `reports/AUDIT_FINAL_STATE.md`.
- `OPS_RUNTIME_PARITY_PASSED`
- `FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE=PASSED`
- `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASSED`
- `FULL_MARKET_DATA_PHPUNIT=PASSED` is backed by the latest operator-local full suite: `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` -> OK (511 tests, 7871 assertions).

[DOC_RECONCILIATION]
- Previous provider-rate-limit/provider-blocked/provider-smoke-review-required wording is `SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_PROVIDER_SMOKE_PASS_AND_FULL_MARKETDATA_PHPUNIT_PASS` for the current source state.
- Previous scheduler missing-artifact wording is `SUPERSEDED_BY_SCHEDULER_DUE_RUN_AND_NON_SILENT_FAILURE_PROOF` for the current source state.
- Scheduler proof is not overclaimed: current artifacts prove due-run execution and non-silent reason-coded failure visibility, not a successful scheduled daily production run.

[SCHEDULER_PROOF]
- `SCHEDULER_DUE_RUN_PROOF_PASSED`
- `SCHEDULER_NON_SILENT_FAILURE_PROOF_PASSED`
- `SCHEDULER_SUCCESSFUL_DAILY_RUN_PROOF_NOT_CLAIMED`
- Scheduler metadata refreshed in `storage/app/market-data/production-scheduler-cron-deployment-proof/reconciliation/artifact-presence-audit.txt` to the uploaded source ZIP identity.

[CODE_PATCHES]
- Provider empty/invalid response now returns `provider_smoke_status=BLOCKED` with `reason_code=PROVIDER_EMPTY_OR_INVALID_RESPONSE`; parse-failed and missing selected trade date outcomes are also BLOCKED.
- Coverage gate flags are runtime-enforced fail-closed: `enabled=false` and `require_canonical_bar_evidence=false` return `NOT_EVALUABLE`; zero-universe behavior records `coverage_zero_universe_blocked`.
- Finalize predecision now uses persisted candidate `seal_state` and run `sealed_at` proof instead of hardcoded `true` / `SEALED`.
- Correction approve transition is strict: only `REQUESTED` can become `APPROVED`; other states are blocked with `COMMAND_CORRECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPROVABLE`.

[VALIDATION]
- Sandbox syntax validation passed for changed PHP source and test files with `php -l`.
- Sandbox PHPUnit could not run because this PHP CLI lacks required PHPUnit extensions: `dom`, `mbstring`, `xml`, and `xmlwriter`.
- Operator-local validation completed after gap-closure patch: ProviderSmokeSafeModeStaticGuardTest OK (6 tests, 169 assertions); Coverage OK (72 tests, 800 assertions); Finalize OK (51 tests, 392 assertions); Correction OK (75 tests, 1416 assertions); StaticGuard OK (194 tests, 4785 assertions); Full MarketData suite: OK (511 tests, 7871 assertions).

[NEXT_ACTION]
- None for Final Provider Smoke Passed / Ops Runtime Parity Lock. Current source state is DONE / LOCKED / PASSED.
- Future changes to provider headers, endpoint template, scheduler proof, audit docs, command surface, or market-data runtime artifacts must rerun targeted guards and full `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData`.
- Recommended next independent hardening scope: CI / Regression Guard to enforce this validation automatically.

[SUPERSEDES]
- Previous provider-smoke / provider-rate-limit / ops-parity review-required next actions are superseded by the final provider smoke PASS and full MarketData PHPUnit PASS.
- Previous active-looking scheduler missing-artifact wording is superseded by current due-run/non-silent-failure artifacts; successful scheduled daily production run proof remains not claimed.
