## Recovery-3 malformed fallback pointer fix — Coverage Gate Enforcement / No Coverage Bypass

- Status: SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_LOCK.
- Local evidence received: static guard, Coverage, Publication, readable, Evidence, Replay, and Command suites passed; one integration/pointer failure remained for malformed fallback pointer effective-date handling.
- Recovery-3 fix: when correction pointer mismatch occurs and no contract-valid readable fallback exists, `trade_date_effective` is explicitly cleared to null instead of retaining the requested candidate date.
- Final result: superseded by Recovery-5 final local validation; `MarketDataPipelineIntegrationTest`, pointer filter, and full `tests/Unit/MarketData` all PASS.

## Recovery-4 fallback mirror fixture alignment — COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT_CONTRACT

- Status: SUPERSEDED_BY_FINAL_LOCK.
- Local evidence received after Recovery-3: all targeted suites except pipeline integration/pointer fallback cases passed; full MarketData suite had four remaining fallback/effective-date failures.
- Enforcement recovery: fallback publication fixtures now satisfy strict pointer/publication/run mirror identity, and correction baseline pointer mismatch is treated as a pointer-integrity failure instead of a generic promotion error.
- Final result: superseded by Recovery-5 final local validation; `MarketDataPipelineIntegrationTest`, pointer filter, and full `tests/Unit/MarketData` all PASS.

## Recovery-5 baseline pointer mismatch message preservation — COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT_CONTRACT

- Status: LOCKED by final local validation.
- Local evidence after Recovery-5: `MarketDataPipelineIntegrationTest`, pointer filter, targeted coverage/finalize/publication/readable/evidence/replay/command suites, core service tests, static guard, and full `tests/Unit/MarketData` all PASS.
- Enforcement recovery: pointer-integrity failures keep specific operator/audit messages for correction baseline mismatch while generic post-switch mismatch cases continue using the generic current publication pointer resolution message.
- Final lock completed for `COVERAGE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT_CONTRACT`.

## HASH_SEAL_DATASET_INTEGRITY_CONTRACT — Recovery round 3

- Status: LOCKED by final local validation.
- Enforcement recovery: replacement candidates must own a complete hashable candidate artifact scope before seal. When a promote run is derived from an existing current/complete seed without fresh candidate bars history, the system creates candidate-bound bars history from current live rows and keeps all derived artifacts/hash/seal operations in history scope.
- Final validation: `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "Finalize"` PASS with `OK (46 tests, 355 assertions)`; `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData --filter "Integration"` PASS with `OK (91 tests, 1443 assertions)`; full `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/MarketData` PASS with `OK (329 tests, 4110 assertions)`.
- Final rule locked: sealed/current/readable live artifacts cannot be mutated before finalize authorizes pointer promotion; candidate replacement artifacts must be built and verified through publication-bound history.
