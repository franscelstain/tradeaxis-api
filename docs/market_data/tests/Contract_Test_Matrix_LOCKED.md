# Contract Test Matrix (LOCKED)

## Purpose
Map every critical upstream contract to explicit proof artifacts so implementation does not guess what must be tested and what evidence each test must assert.

This matrix is normative.
A test suite is not complete merely because code paths execute without error.

## Matrix rules (LOCKED)
1. Every critical contract must map to at least one positive or negative test.
2. A contract that can fail in materially different ways should have separate tests for each important failure mode.
3. Each test must identify:
   - fixture family
   - row-level assertions
   - run-level assertions
   - hash assertions where applicable
   - publication assertions where applicable
   - replay assertions where applicable
4. A test that only proves process completion is insufficient.
5. Historical correction behavior must prove both preservation of prior state and correctness of the new current state.
6. Determinism behavior must prove both equality-under-same-input and inequality-under-real-content-change.

## Minimum assertion payload per implemented test (LOCKED)
Every implemented test must explicitly identify and assert:

### Row-level assertions
Examples:
- expected canonical rows
- expected invalid rows
- expected indicator values
- expected eligibility rows
- expected reason codes

### Run-level assertions
Examples:
- expected terminal status
- expected effective trade date
- expected counts
- expected warning/hard reject counts
- expected seal presence or absence

### Hash assertions
Examples:
- exact expected bars hash
- exact expected indicators hash
- exact expected eligibility hash
- equality across identical reruns
- inequality across changed-content correction runs

### Publication assertions
Examples:
- current publication did or did not switch
- superseded publication preserved
- unchanged rerun did not create a new current publication
- only one current publication resolves for D

### Replay assertions
Examples:
- comparison_result class
- mismatch summary expectation
- expected-vs-actual output alignment
- config-identity-sensitive reproducibility

## Anti-fake-proof rule (LOCKED)
A test that proves only “the process ran” or “no exception occurred” does not satisfy this matrix.

## Coverage gate proof minimums (LOCKED)
Any implementation claiming coverage-gate compliance must prove at minimum:
- denominator source = resolved coverage universe as-of requested date
- numerator source = canonical valid EOD bars as-of requested date
- threshold is explicit and audit-visible
- zero-universe path does not auto-pass
- requested date never becomes readable when coverage gate = `FAIL` or `NOT_EVALUABLE`
