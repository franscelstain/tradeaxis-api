# Executed Run Admission Criteria (LOCKED)

## Purpose
Define when an artifact may be honestly described as a real executed evidence artifact rather than a shape example or proof-spec example.

## Core rule (LOCKED)
An artifact may be labeled as executed evidence only if it is sourced from an actual run, replay, correction, or test execution context.

## Admission criteria
A candidate executed artifact must satisfy all of the following:

1. it references a real execution identity, such as:
   - run_id
   - replay_id
   - correction_id
   - test_id plus actual execution metadata

2. it contains actual produced values, such as:
   - real hashes
   - real counts
   - real timestamps
   - real terminal states
   - real publication IDs

3. it is not composed solely of placeholders such as:
   - `H1B`
   - `A1`
   - `example_run_id`
   - fabricated timestamps

4. it can be traced back to a real execution context or archived execution bundle

## Recommended labeling
Executed evidence artifacts should explicitly state one of:
- `Source: actual executed run`
- `Source: actual executed replay`
- `Source: actual executed correction`
- `Source: actual executed test`

## Non-admissible examples
The following do not count as executed evidence:
- illustrative JSON shapes with placeholder hashes
- manually fabricated example outputs with no execution trace
- examples whose values are obviously symbolic only

## Cross-contract alignment
This contract must remain aligned with:
- `Run_Execution_Evidence_Pack_Contract_LOCKED.md`
- examples folder artifacts
- testing proof contracts

## Anti-ambiguity rule (LOCKED)
If a reader cannot tell whether an artifact is illustrative or actually executed, the evidence labeling is too weak.
