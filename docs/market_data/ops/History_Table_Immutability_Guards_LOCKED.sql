-- LOCKED SEMANTICS
-- 1. History tables are append-only snapshot tables.
-- 2. A publication-specific snapshot may be inserted once, but never updated in place.
-- 3. Removal of history rows in normal operation is forbidden.
-- 4. If exceptional maintenance is ever needed, it must be handled outside normal production flow and versioned/documented explicitly.
